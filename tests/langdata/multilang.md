# Comparing and contrasting

For some ideas about an api, we might give getting started code in a simple getting started page.

In a pinch, let's hello that world.

```py
print("hello, world")
```

But maybe we want this to be enterprise grade?

```java
class HelloWorld {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.println("Hello, World!"); 
  }
}
```

New orders from the CTO: let's use Azure cloud.
```cs
class HelloWorld {
  static void Main() {
    System.Console.WriteLine("Hello World");
  }
}
```
